# Pinned

#### https://pinned-heroku.herokuapp.com/
<br />
Pinned is my first web application that I built as my breakable toy project during the course of Launch Academy. It is a Ruby on Rails app with a React.js front end. This was my first attempt at putting my business background and my newly acquired web development skills together. I wanted to solve the problem of tedious trip planning by building a review site where users can put up itineraries of their trip or hangout. Users can also build their itinerary based on recommendations from the Yelp API and see the directions from the routes generated by the Google Maps API. 

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your machine

2. Navigate to the cloned repository

3. Run the following from the command line to install all necessary dependencies:

  `$ bundle install`
  `$ yarn install`

4. Create the database and run migrations

  `$ bundle exec rake db:create`
  `$ bundle exec rake db:migrate`

5. Start the rails server and webpack server

  `$ rails s`
  `$ yarn start`

6. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser. Google Chrome is recommended.

Test Suite
To run RSpec test, please run from the command line:

`$ bundle exec rspec`

The test suite consists of Model and Controller tests and Enzyme feature tests. More test will be added on.

### Future Plans
